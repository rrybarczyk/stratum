# Performs test coverage of project's libraries using cargo-tarpaulin and generates results using
# codecov.io.
# The follow flags are used when executing cargo-tarpaulin:
# -- features: Includes the code with the listed features. The following features result in a
#    tarpaulin error and are NOT included: derive, alloc, arbitrary-derive, attributes, and
#    with_serde
# --lib: Only tests the package's library unit tests. Includes protocols, and utils (without the
#   exclude-files flag, it includes this example because it contains a lib.rs file)
# --exclude-files examples/*: Excludes all projects in examples directory (specifically added to
#   ignore examples that that contain a lib.rs file like interop-cpp)
# --timeout 120: If unresponsive for 120 seconds, action will fail
# --fail-under 40: If code coverage is less than 40%, action will fail
# --out Xml: Required for codecov.io to generate coverage result
