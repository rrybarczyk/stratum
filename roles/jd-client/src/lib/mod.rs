/// Is used by the template receiver and the downstream. When a NewTemplate is received the context
/// that is running the template receiver set this value to false and then the message is sent to
/// the context that is running the Downstream that do something and then set it back to true.
///
/// In the meantime if the context that is running the template receiver receives a SetNewPrevHash
/// it wait until the value of this global is true before doing anything.

/// Acuire and Release memory ordering is used.
///
/// Memory Ordering Explanation:
/// We use Acquire-Release ordering instead of SeqCst or Relaxed for the following reasons:
/// 1. Acquire in template receiver context ensures we see all operations before the Release store
///    the downstream.
/// 2. Within the same execution context (template receiver), a Relaxed store followed by an Acquire
///    load is sufficient. This is because operations within the same context execute in the order
///    they appear in the code.
/// 3. The combination of Release in downstream and Acquire in template receiver contexts establishes
///    a happens-before relationship, guaranteeing that we handle the SetNewPrevHash message after
///    that downstream have finished handling the NewTemplate.
/// 3. SeqCst is overkill we only need to synchronize two contexts, a globally agreed-upon order
///    between all the contexts is not necessary.
