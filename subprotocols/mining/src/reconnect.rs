/// This message is connection-related so that it should not be propagated downstream by
/// intermediate proxies. Upon receiving the message, the client re-initiates the Noise handshake
/// and uses the poolâ€™s authority public key to verify that the certificate presented by the new
/// server has a valid signature.
///
/// For security reasons, it is not possible to reconnect to a server with a certificate signed by a
/// different pool authority key. The message intentionally does *not* contain a **pool public key** and
/// thus cannot be used to reconnect to a different pool. This ensures that an attacker will not be
/// able to redirect hashrate to an arbitrary server should the pool server get compromised and
/// instructed to send reconnects to a new location.
